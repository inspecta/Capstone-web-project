# Capstone Project

> This project will be a replica of CC-Global-Summit-2015 website from https://www.behance.net/ gallery. It's a capstone project of the skills and knowledge I have obtained during my first module at Microverse.

> It consists of two pages (home and about pages) and these are responsive depending on the screen side.

> It is accessible to all kinds of readers because it's designed with the highly recommended semantic tags, amazing color contrasts, photos and icons.
